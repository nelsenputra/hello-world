# hello-world
Just a time-honored tradition in computer programming. A simple excercise that gets me started when learning something new.

Hi, Nelsen's here! How are you doing? Do you know that I love music and travelling so much? Yeah, those are my irreplaceable passion!
I really need to work on my coding and programming skills because it hasn't been my passion yet as for now.
